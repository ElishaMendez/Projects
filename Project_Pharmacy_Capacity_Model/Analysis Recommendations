##Top 4 Recommendations
Based on the capacity model analysis, here are my highest priority suggestions:

1. Validate the Model Against Reality
- Compared actual daily output to the model's 3,957.5 orders/day projection
- If we track this for 2-4 weeks to see if we're consistently above, below, or hitting target
- If there's a gap, document why (order complexity, system downtime, supply issues, etc.)
- This tells us if the model is useful or needs updating

If so,
2. Build a Tracking System
- Set up a simple daily tracker: Model Projection vs. Actual Output
- When actual is significantly different, document the reason
- This creates data to either validate the model or identify consistent problem areas
- Over time, shows us where we have capacity issues vs. where the model maybe ineffective

3. Investigate the Performance Gap
- The model assumes top performers produce 50% more than lower performers (600 vs 300 orders/shift)
- Need to figure out if this is:
    1. Experience/skill-based → training opportunity
    2. Task assignment-based → they're getting different types of orders
    3. Realistic long-term → or are high performers burning out?
- Could close a big chunk of the capacity gap if we can bring lower performers up
- Could reinforce training on a daily, weekly, monthly bases
- Designated Lead Techs specifically for training purposes and guiding workflow

If so,
4. Optimize Morning Task Allocation
- Model shows all 10 techs start on "Fill" at 8:30 AM
- Data suggests 1,874 orders done by 11 AM but only 652 more by 1 PM because of lunches
- Can potentially start earlier in the day
- Set a capacity of daily output (i.e. 2,000 orders in a day)

Quick win: Start with #1 and #2 since they're just data collection - they'll tell us if recommendations #3 and #4 are even worth pursuing.
