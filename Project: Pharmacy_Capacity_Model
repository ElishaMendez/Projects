Top 4 Recommendations for the Director
Based on the capacity model analysis, here are my highest priority suggestions:
1. Validate the Model Against Reality

Compare actual daily output to the model's 3,957.5 orders/day projection
Track this for 2-4 weeks to see if we're consistently above, below, or hitting target
If there's a gap, document why (order complexity, system downtime, supply issues, etc.)
This tells us if the model is useful or needs updating

2. Investigate the Performance Gap

The model assumes Jennifer & Eli produce 50% more than Elena & Teamiller (600 vs 300 orders/shift)
Need to figure out if this is:

Experience/skill-based → training opportunity
Task assignment-based → they're getting different types of orders
Realistic long-term → or are high performers burning out?


Could close a big chunk of the capacity gap if we can bring lower performers up

3. Optimize Morning Task Allocation

Model shows all 10 techs start on "Fill" at 8:30 AM
Data suggests 1,874 orders done by 11 AM but only 652 more by 1 PM
Question: Are we overstaffing Fill in the morning while creating bottlenecks in Packing/Shipping later?
Maybe stagger task assignments earlier in the day?

4. Build a Tracking System

Set up a simple daily tracker: Model Projection vs. Actual Output
When actual is significantly different, document the reason
This creates data to either validate the model or identify consistent problem areas
Over time, shows us where we have capacity issues vs. where the model is just wrong

Quick win: Start with #1 and #4 since they're just data collection - they'll tell us if recommendations #2 and #3 are even worth pursuing.
